This repository contains the code for our work "GSI: An Influential Node Detection Approach in Heterogeneous Network using Covid-19 as Use Case".

This work mainly focuses on the influential node detection approach in real-world complex network analysis. This approach combines local and global parameters to obtain the influence of each node in the network. Effect of GSI is evaluated by using complex network and epidemiological data. The GSI approach is illustrated with the toy example, and the effect of GSI on the epidemiological data is also provided.
